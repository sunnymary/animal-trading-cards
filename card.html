			<p>Giant Panda was classified by IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) in 2016 as "endangered species". Most giant pandas now live in southwestern China, because they like the bamboo forests and weather there. Pandas are so cute and lovable with black and white fur. They are considered as national treasures in China. </p>
